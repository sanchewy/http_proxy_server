Eclipse, Java, gradlew project. 

Implement a multi-threaded HTTP proxy server that passes requests and data between web clients and web servers.

## Running
I'm using jdk17 and gradle 7.6, but you should be able to use whatever jdk/gradle version as long as the two are compatible.

`./gradlew run`
